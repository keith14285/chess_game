Building a fully functional chess game using the pygame module in Python.

The program can detect all valid moves for all pieces, and identify checkmate and stalemate.  En Passant and castling are working properly in this program as well.

The UI along with the structure of the chessboard (setting up the class) was done with the help of an online tutorial.  Will look to add some other functionalities like simple AI algorithm in the future.
